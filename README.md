### PHASE 0: get the thing to work (build database)

add saving the data

parse BofA and WF statements (handle all cases)

### PHASE 1: get enough of a view of spending history to make a budget

total monthly spending over time (graph)

categorized monthly spending over time (graph)

average monthly spending (number)

average monthly spending by category (numbers)

### PHASE 2: advanced graphs and future planning/monitoring

adding budget information to the database

individual category monthly spending over time

target spending lines on graphs

budgets for categories where the target line is a straight line from (0,0) to (1 year later, the budget) and the data is cumulative year-to-date date for that category so we can see how far into the spending limit for that category we are and whether we are ahead or behind of the spending velocity for that category for this particular year.
